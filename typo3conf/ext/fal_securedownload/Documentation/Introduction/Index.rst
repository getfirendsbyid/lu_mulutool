What does it do?
================

This extension (fal_securedownload) aims to be a general solution to secure your assets.

When you storage is marked as non-public all links to files from that storage are replaced (also for processed files).

The permissions for assets can be set on folder/file bases by setting access to fe_groups in the file module.

There is also a plugin to show your files as a tree on your website.
